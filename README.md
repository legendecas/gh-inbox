# gh-inbox

Improved GitHub Notification inbox workflow. Heavily inspired by [octobox](https://github.com/octobox/octobox).

All data are stored locally, communicating with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise with user's explicit
consent, via Personal Access Tokens.

## Get Started

I don't have an Apple Developer account, so serve yourself ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run package
$ cp -R out/gh-inbox-darwin-arm64/gh-inbox.app /Applications/
$ open /Applications/gh-inbox.app
```
